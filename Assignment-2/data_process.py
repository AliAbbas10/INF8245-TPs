        This function should be very similar to the preprocess mnist data function except that we
        have a header, the classes column has name Class and you can discard the column:
    • Open the pair of csv files as input using pandas, keeping the header and using
    column id as our index
    • extract the column Class for both,
    • perform scaling column wise: substract, for each column, its mean and divide
    by its standard deviation, as computed on the train set.
    • return the result as numpy arrays
